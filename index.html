        <div class="content">
          The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has a party-dominated
          authoritarian government, in which the Chinese Communisty Party (CCP)
          exercises exclusive political leadership. The National People’s
          Congress (NPC) is the highest legislative body of the PRC, operating
          as a unicameral legislature that reviews legislations and elects the
          President of the PRC. The National People’s Congress meets for about
          two weeks annually to review major political agenda, whereas the
          Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPCSC) is the
          permanent legislative body that decides on most national legislation.
          Aside from the annual session of the NPC, a NPC session can convene
          with the Standing Committee’s decision or with a petition from
          one-fifth of the NPC delegates. (ref. 1)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          The current governing party is the Chinese Communist Party, with Xi
          Jinping as General Secretary of the party and the President of the
          state. The NPC is headed by Li Zhanshu, who serves as the Chairman of
          the Standing Committee of the NPC and is the third-ranking member of
          the Politburo Standing Committee of the CCP.

      <summary class="title">2. Electoral System</summary>
      <div class="detail-contents">
        <div class="content">
          In the thirteenth NPC, which lasts from 2018 to 2023, there are 2980
          total deputies. Of which there are 742 women and 438 representing
          ethnicities other than Han Chinese. (ref. 2) Deputies of the NPC are
          elected to five-year terms via multi-tiered indirect elections.
          Citizens directly elect deputies to the People’s Congresses at the
          lowest level, be it municipal districts, counties, or townships.
          Deputies to the NPC and the People’s Congresses of provincial or city
          level are elected by the People’s Congresses at the next lower level.
          (ref. 3)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Candidates can be recommended by political parties, mass
          organizations, or a minimum of 10 citizens in direct or 10 deputies in
          indirect elections. Election committees, appointed by the standing
          committee of the People’s Congress at the corresponding level, and a
          small group of voters participate in a primary process that narrows
          down the number of candidates to 130 to 200 percent of the number of
          deputies in direct election, and 120 to 150 percent in indirect
          elections. (ref. 4)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          The electoral system can be best described as combined approval
          voting, where voters do not choose between candidates, rather vote
          yes, no, or abstain for each candidate. Voters, or deputies for higher
          levels of People’s Congresses, are allowed to vote yes on as many
          seats as available in the district. They are also allowed to write in
          additional candidates.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          For local elections for the lowest level of People’s Congresses,
          district magnitude varies from one to three members per district. The
          size of districts also differs from several hundred voters in
          townships to several thousands in counties. This largely reflects the
          administrative division in China, and is less attuned to the district
          sizes being proportional to population divided by seats.

    <details id="seat" style="top: 45px; left: 510px">
      <summary class="title">3. Seat Allocation</summary>
      <div class="detail-contents">
        <div class="content">
          According to the allocation formula first put in place in 2010, there
          are 35 electoral districts for the National People’s Congress: 31
          representing the mainland province-level units (including provinces,
          autonomous regions, and directly government municipalities), and one
          each for Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the People’s Liberation Army.
          (ref. 5) Seats for province-level units are split into three
          categories: population-based proportional allocation, fixed amount
          allocation (similar to the US Senate), and other allocations. Other
          allocations include diversity seats allocated to minorities and
          reserved seats for incoming or prominent leaders, such as leaders of
          minor political parties and mass organizations or public figures.
          Nominees for reserved seats would be decided on by CCP leadership and
          referred to various provinces for elections, which tend to be
          birthplaces or places of employment.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          For the twelfth NPC, 2,000 seats were allocated based on the
          population of province-level units, with one delegate for roughly
          670,000 people. In addition, eight seats were allocated to each
          province. Other allocations are decided by the Standing Committee of
          the NPC in an opaque manner.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Hong Kong and Macao have been allocated 36 and 12 seats respectively
          since they were transferred back to China. Delegates from those cities
          are elected via ad-hoc electoral colleges. (ref. 6) Taiwan has been
          allocated 13 seats historically, which are decided by ad-hoc
          consultative election meetings formed by representatives of Taiwanese
          ancestry. The military has been allocated 265 seats generally, which
          is the most of all electoral units. The military’s seats are elected
          by the servicemember congresses of various branches of the PLA.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Around 12% of all delegates in the NPC are required to be ethnic
          minorities. This roughly translates to 360 seats. Each of the 55
          ethnic minorities are required to have at least one seat, with the
          distribution of quota seats among provinces proportional to the
          minority population. There is a quota of 35 seats for citizens who
          returned to China after giving up long term residency in foreign
          countries. The allocation rules also have guidelines for encouraging
          an “appropriate” number of women and frontline personnel, such as
          farmers or factory workers.

      <summary class="title">4. Party System</summary>
      <div class="detail-contents">
        <div class="content">
          The party system in the PRC is non-competitive. The CCP heads a
          coalition with eight other minor parties called the United Front. The
          following are the eight parties that participate in the political
          system and accept the leading role of the CCP. These are also the only
          political parties that are allowed to exist:
          <li>China Zhi Gong Party</li>
          <li>Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party</li>
          <li>China Democratic League</li>
          <li>Jiusan Society</li>
          <li>China National Democratic Construction Association</li>
          <li>China Association for Promoting Democracy</li>
          <li>Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League</li>
          <li>Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang</li>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          While the Chinese government does not exercise total control over the
          lives of citizens, the CCP exercises total control over the party and
          electoral system. The CCP claims the “leading role” in the political
          process and decides which parties are allowed to exist (the nine
          parties in the United Front are the only ones with seats in the NPC
          beside independents). Thus, the party system might be best
          characterized as totalitarian.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          The eight minor parties play an advisory role rather than an
          oppositional role. (ref. 7) Within the political system, there are no
          organized opposition movements. Kuomintang, or the Chinese Nationalist
          Party, is the most prominent party in exile. It led the Republic of
          China in the mainland until the end of World War II, at which point it
          was defeated by the Communists in a civil war. Kuomintang is now
          active in Taiwanese politics.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          To calculate the effective number of parties, we plug in 9 as the
          number of parties. The breakdown of seats in the 2018-2023 NPC is as
          followed:
          <li style="padding-top: 10px">CCP: 70.13%</li>
          <li>Jiusan Society: 2.11%</li>
          <li>China Zhi Gong Party: 1.28%</li>
          <li>Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: 1.81%</li>
          <li>China Democratic League: 1.91%</li>
          <li>China National Democratic Construction Association: 1.91%</li>
          <li>China Association for Promoting Democracy: 1.95%</li>
          <li>Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League: 0.44%</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: 1.48%
          </li>
          Using Laakso and Taagerpera’s formula, the effective number of parties
          turns out to be 1/0.494 = 2.02. The number of relevant parties is less
          than this calculation, which might be due to the fact that there are
          470 independent members in the NPC, while in practice, they are also
          aligned to the CCP and the United Front.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          Because the NPC does not publish the vote share of each party, it is
          not possible to calculate proportionality using the Gallagher formula.

      <div class="detail-contents">
        <div class="content">
          The CCP is the sole governing party of China. It won 2090 of 2980
          seats in the NPC in the 2018 election and holds 118 of 175 seats in
          the Standing Committee of the NPC.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          The CCP operates with a very clear organization, with one General
          Secretary at the top and layers of power until party committees in
          neighborhoods and workplaces. From top to bottom, the power structure
          at the national level pans out like the following:
          <li style="padding-top: 10px">
            the General Secretary of the Central Committee
          </li>
          <li>the Politburo Standing Committee</li>
          <li>the Central Committee Politburo</li>
          <li>the Central Committee</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">the National Congress of the CCP</li>
          The National Congress elects the Central Committee, the Central
          Committee elects the Politburo and the General Secretary.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          The CCP National Congress convenes every five years. In the time that
          it is not in session, authority over party affairs is transferred to
          the Central Committee, and then to the Politburo, and then to the
          Politburo Standing Committee, as none of the three aforementioned
          organizations have a standing component. The full Politburo generally
          meets monthly, while its Standing Committee meets weekly.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          The Central Committee usually consists of national leaders, party
          department leaders, State Council leaders, NPC leaders, leaders at the
          Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
          military leaders, provincial-level unit leaders, some municipal-level
          unit leaders, some mass organization leaders, as well as some
          state-owned enterprise leaders. Politburo Standing Committee members
          usually include the General Secretary (concurrently the President of
          the state and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission), the
          Premier of the State Council, the Chairman of the NPCSC, the Chairman
          of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the
          Secretary of the Central Secretariat (responsible for party
          operations), the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline
          Inspection, and a vice premier. Currently, these posts are held by Xi
          Jinping, Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji,
          and Han Zheng, respectively.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Despite the nominal election process, the Politburo and its Standing
          Committee are understood to name their own successors through
          deliberations with current and retired members. Party posts at all
          levels are managed from the Party Central through the Organization
          Department of the CCP, which staffs all levels of government and
          state-owned enterprises. This means that the elections that occur in
          the local party congresses do not have validity or decision making
          power of their own. Before Xi became General Secretary, the political
          process was “rule by consensus” among national leaders. But since Xi’s
          ascension, one-man rule has become more pronounced. As a result, the
          party is both centralized and undemocratic.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Each administrative level from province-level units to municipal
          districts have their local congresses, which nominally elect the
          leadership committees for their respective level. All government
          officials concurrently hold party posts. For instance, the Premier of
          the State Council is concurrently the Secretary of the State Council
          Party Branch, and the mayor of a city would be a vice secretary of the
          city’s party committee. This guarantees the party’s control over the
          state.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          As the CCP exercises exclusive control over Chinese politics, it has
          to appeal to the general population. As the Three Represents theory of
          the then-General Secretary of the CCP Jiang Zemin states, the party
          must always represent “the fundamental interests of the overwhelming
          majority of the Chinese people.” As such, it would be hard to slot the
          part on a right-left dimension. While the Party does not appeal to any
          interest group more than others, it endorses several official
          subsidiary organizations of interests, such as the All-China Students'
          Federation, the Communist Youth League of China, the All-China
          Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China Women’s Federation.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Although the Party is founded on communist ideology, it governs in
          accordance with “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” which has
          adopted many facets of capitalism. Although traditionally communist
          parties are to the left of the political spectrum, the CCP might be
          better characterized as occupying the center-right with its emphasis
          on nationalism and patriotism as well as its attitude against social
          liberalization. The Party’s policy and ideological emphasis have
          oscillated as the populace has evolved: for instance, as the wealth
          gap widens, the “let some people get rich first” ideology of Deng
          Xiaoping transitioned into the “common prosperity” ideology of Xi
          Jinping. (ref. 8)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          To join the CCP, applicants have to submit essays, go through a
          pledging process, and be approved. In 2014, only 2 million members
          were admitted out of 22 million applicants. (ref. 9) The
          competitiveness results from the fact that party membership opens up
          career opportunities. Party members are required to pay a membership
          fee via a percentage of their income. (ref. 10) The constitution and
          rules of the party are accessible online, however, a lot of the inner
          workings of the party remain opaque, such as the decision making
          process and reasons for personnel assignment. (ref. 11)

      <div class="detail-contents">
        <div class="content">
          The next important election to be held will be the Presidential
          election scheduled for the fourteenth NPC in 2023. As Xi Jinping’s
          third term as General Secretary of the CCP is renewed at the twentieth
          National Congress of the CCP in October 2022, he is expected to win
          the presidency for a third time. (ref. 12) Historically, the President
          is also the General Secretary of the Party and the Chairman of the
          Central Military Commission. As the role of the President is mostly
          ceremonial and acts in accordance with directions from the NPCSC,
          which is controlled by the Party, real power is contained in the
          General Secretary and Chairman titles. Historically, presidents did
          not always have the other two posts. For instance, in the period that
          Deng Xiaoping led China, he did so with only the Chairman of the
          Central Military Commission title, while the presidents during that
          era were sidelined. However, since the 1990s, it has been the norm
          that the President holds all three positions concurrently.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          There was a two-term limit on the presidency in the original
          constitution of the PRC. This limit was removed in 2018 as Xi
          solidified his power and eyed a third term1. The vote percentage for
          the President has hovered between 97 to 99 percent in the past, but
          the last election in 2018 was the first time when the presidential
          candidate won 100 percent of the NPC’s approval. As Xi has eradicated
          dissent, it’s highly likely that he will win with 100 percent in the
          next election. In fact, election results for many other offices during
          the 2018 NPC were at 100 percent, signaling a shift toward more
          totalitarian politics with less room for dissent. (ref. 13)
